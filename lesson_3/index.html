               <h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
               <p>
                    Ballet (French: [balɛ]) is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian
                    Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and
                    Russia.
               </p>
               <p>
                    It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques which are used in
                    many other dance genres and cultures. Various schools around the world have incorporated their own
                    cultures. As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways.
               </p>
               <p>
                    A ballet as a unified work comprises the
                    choreography and music for a ballet production. Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained
                    ballet dancers. Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music
                    accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets are often performed in
                    simple costumes and without elaborate sets or scenery.

                    Ballet is a French word which had its origin in Italian balletto, a diminutive of ballo (dance)
                    which comes from Latin ballo, ballare, meaning "to dance", which in turn comes from the Greek
                    "βαλλίζω" (ballizo), "to dance, to jump about". The word came into English usage from the French
                    around 1630.

               <h2>HISTORY</h2>
               <p>
                    Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Under
                    Catherine de' Medici's influence as Queen, it spread to France, where it developed even further.
                    The dancers in these early court ballets were mostly noble amateurs. Ornamented costumes were meant
                    to impress viewers, but they restricted performers' freedom of movement. The ballets were
                    performed in large chambers with viewers on three sides. The implementation of the proscenium arch
                    from 1618 on distanced performers from audience members, who could then better view and appreciate
                    the technical feats of the professional dancers in the productions.[citation needed] French court
                    ballet reached its height under the reign of King Louis XIV. Louis founded the Académie Royale de
                    Danse (Royal Dance Academy) in 1661 to establish standards and certify dance instructors. In
                    1672, Louis XIV made Jean-Baptiste Lully the director of the Académie Royale de Musique (Paris
                    Opera) from which the first professional ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, arose. Pierre
                    Beauchamp served as Lully's ballet-master. Together their partnership would drastically influence
                    the development of ballet, as evidenced by the credit given to them for the creation of the five
                    major positions of the feet. By 1681, the first "ballerinas" took the stage following years of
                    training at the Académie. Ballet started to decline in France after 1830, but it continued to
                    develop in Denmark, Italy, and Russia. The arrival in Europe of the Ballets Russes led by Sergei
                    Diaghilev on the eve of the First World War revived interest in the ballet and started the modern
                    era. In the twentieth century, ballet had a wide influence on other dance genres, Also in the
                    twentieth century, ballet took a turn dividing it from classical ballet to the introduction of
                    modern dance, leading to modernist movements in several countries. Famous dancers of the
                    twentieth century include Anna Pavlova, Galina Ulanova, Rudolf Nureyev, Maya Plisetskaya, Margot
                    Fonteyn, Rosella Hightower, Maria Tall Chief, Erik Bruhn, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Suzanne Farrell,
                    Gelsey Kirkland, Natalia Makarova, Arthur Mitchell, and Jeanne Devereaux. Jeanne Devereaux
                    performed as a prima ballerina for three decades and set a world's record by being able to execute
                    16 triple fouettes.

               <p>
                    Stylistic variations and subgenres have evolved over time. Early, classical variations are primarily
                    associated with geographic origin. Examples of this are Russian ballet, French ballet, and Italian
                    ballet. Later variations, such as contemporary ballet and neoclassical ballet, incorporate both
                    classical ballet and non-traditional technique and movement. Perhaps the most widely known and
                    performed ballet style is late Romantic ballet (or Ballet blanc).

                    <h3>Classical ballet</h3>
                    <p>
                         Classical ballet is based on traditional ballet technique and vocabulary. Different styles
                         have emerged in different countries, such as French ballet, Italian ballet, English ballet, and
                         Russian ballet. Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training
                         methods, typically named after their creators (see below). The Royal Academy of Dance method is
                         a ballet technique and training system that was founded by a diverse group of ballet dancers.
                         They merged their respective dance methods (Italian, French, Danish and Russian) to create a
                         new style of ballet that is unique to the organization and is recognized internationally as the
                         English style of ballet. Some examples of classical ballet productions are: Swan Lake, The
                         Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker.

                    <h3>Romantic ballet</h3>
                    <p>
                         Romantic ballet was an artistic movement of classical ballet and several productions remain in
                         the classical repertoire today. The Romantic era was marked by the emergence of pointe work,
                         the dominance of female dancers, and longer, flowy tutus that attempt to exemplify softness and
                         a delicate aura. This movement occurred during the early to mid-nineteenth century (the
                         Romantic era) and featured themes that emphasized intense emotion as a source of aesthetic
                         experience. The plots of many romantic ballets revolved around spirit women (sylphs, wilis, and
                         ghosts) who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men. The 1827 ballet La Sylphide is widely
                         considered to be the first, and the 1870 ballet Coppélia is considered to be the last.
                         Famous ballet dancers of the Romantic era include Marie Taglioni, Fanny Elssler, and Jules
                         Perrot. Jules Perrot is also known for his choreography, especially that of Giselle, often
                         considered to be the most widely celebrated romantic ballet.

               <div class="neoclassical-ballet orange">
                    <h3>Neoclassical ballet</h3>
                    <p>
                         Neoclassical ballet is usually abstract, with no clear plot, costumes or scenery. Music choice
                         can be diverse and will often include music that is also neoclassical (e.g. Stravinsky,
                         Roussel). Tim Scholl, author of From Petipa to Balanchine, considers George Balanchine's Apollo
                         in 1928 to be the first neoclassical ballet. Apollo represented a return to form in response to
                         Sergei Diaghilev's abstract ballets. Balanchine worked with modern dance choreographer Martha
                         Graham, and brought modern dancers into his company such as Paul Taylor, who in 1959 performed
                         in Balanchine's Episodes. While Balanchine is widely considered the face of neoclassical
                         ballet, there were others who made significant contributions. Frederick Ashton’s Symphonic
                         Variations (1946) is a seminal work for the choreographer. Set to César Franck’s score of the
                         same title, it is a pure-dance interpretation of the score. Another form, Modern Ballet,
                         also emerged as an offshoot of neoclassicism. Among the innovators in this form were Glen
                         Tetley, Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino. While difficult to parse modern ballet from
                         neoclassicism, the work of these choreographers favored a greater athleticism that departed
                         from the delicacy of ballet. The physicality was more daring, with mood, subject matter and
                         music more intense. An example of this would be Joffrey's Astarte (1967), which featured a rock
                         score and sexual overtones in the choreography.

               <div class="contemporary-ballet blue">
                    <h3>Contemporary ballet</h3>
                    <p>
                         This ballet style is often performed barefoot. Contemporary ballets may include mime and
                         acting, and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal). It can be
                         difficult to differentiate this form from neoclassical or modern ballet. Contemporary ballet is
                         also close to contemporary dance because many contemporary ballet concepts come from the ideas
                         and innovations of twentieth-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the
                         legs. The main distinction is that ballet technique is essential to perform a contemporary
                         ballet.George Balanchine is considered to have been a pioneer of contemporary ballet. Another
                         early contemporary ballet choreographer, Twyla Tharp, choreographed Push Comes To Shove for the
                         American Ballet Theatre in 1976, and in 1986 created In The Upper Room for her own company.
                         Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their melding of distinctly modern
                         movements with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers. Today there are many
                         contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include Alonzo King and his company
                         LINES Ballet; Matthew Bourne and his company New Adventures; Complexions Contemporary Ballet;
                         Nacho Duato and his Compañia Nacional de Danza; William Forsythe and The Forsythe Company; and
                         Jiří Kylián of the Nederlands Dans Theater. Traditionally "classical" companies, such as the
                         Mariinsky (Kirov) Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, also regularly perform contemporary works.
                         The term ballet has evolved to include all forms associated with it. Someone training as a
                         ballet dancer will now be expected to perform neoclassical, modern and contemporary work. A
                         ballet dancer is expected to be able to be stately and regal for classical work, free and
                         lyrical in neoclassical work, and unassuming, harsh or pedestrian for modern and contemporary
                         work. In addition, there are several modern varieties of dance that fuse classical ballet
                         technique with contemporary dance, such as Hiplet, that require dancers to be practised in
                         non-Western dance styles.

               <h2>TECHNICAL METHODS OF BALLET INSTRUCTION</h2>
               <p>
                    There are six widely used, internationally recognized methods to teach or study ballet. These
                    methods are the French School, the Vaganova Method, the Cecchetti Method, the Bournonville method,
                    the Royal Academy of Dance method (English style), and the Balanchine method (American style). Many
                    more schools of technique exist in various countries. Although preschool-age children are a
                    lucrative source of income for a ballet studio, ballet instruction is generally not appropriate for
                    young children. Initial instruction requires standing still and
                    concentrating on posture, rather than dancing. Because of this, many ballet programs have
                    historically not accepted students until approximately age 8. Creative movement and non-demanding
                    pre-ballet classes are recommended as alternatives for children.
               </p>
               <div class="french-method">
                    <h3>French method</h3>
                    <img src="img/image_02.jpg" alt="french couple dancing pas dedeux">
                    <p>
                         The French method is the basis of all ballet training. When Louis XIV created the Académie
                         Royale de Danse in 1661, he helped to create the codified technique still used today by those
                         in the profession, regardless of what method of training they adhere to. The French school was
                         particularly revitalized under Rudolf Nureyev, in the 1980s. His influence revitalized and
                         renewed appreciation for this style, and has drastically shaped ballet as a whole. In fact,
                         the French school is now sometimes referred to as Nureyev school. The French method is often
                         characterized by technical precision, fluidity and gracefulness, and elegant, clean lines. For
                         this style, fast footwork is often utilized in order to give the impression that the performers
                         are drifting lightly across the stage. Two important trademarks of this technique are the
                         specific way in which the port de bras and the épaulement are performed, more rounded than when
                         dancing in a Russian style, but not as rounded as the Danish style.

                         The Vaganova method is a style of ballet training that emerged from Russian ballet, created by
                         Agrippina Vaganova. After retiring from dance in 1916, Vaganova turned to teaching at the
                         Leningrad Choreographic School in 1921. Her training method is now internationally recognized
                         and her book, The Fundamentals of Classical Dance (1934), is a classic reference. This method
                         is marked by the fusion of the classical French style, specifically elements from the Romantic
                         era, with the athleticism of the Italian method, and the soulful passion of Russian ballet.
                         She developed an extremely precise method of instruction in her book Basic Principles of
                         Russian Classical dance (1948). This includes outlining when to teach technical components to
                         students in their ballet careers, for how long to focus on it, and the right amount of focus at
                         each stage of the student's career. These textbooks continue to be extremely important to the
                         instruction of ballet today. The method emphasizes development of strength, flexibility, and
                         endurance for the proper performance of ballet. She espoused the belief that equal importance
                         should be placed on the arms and legs while performing ballet, as this will bring harmony and
                         greater expression to the body as a whole.

                         Developed by Enrico Cecchetti (1850-1928), this method is one known internationally for its
                         intense reliance of the understanding of anatomy as it relates to classical ballet. The goal of
                         this method is to instill important characteristics for the performance of ballet into students
                         so that they do not need to rely on imitations of teachers. Important components for this
                         method is the emphasis of balance, elevations, ballon, poise, and strength. This method
                         espouses the importance of recognizing that all parts of the body move together to create
                         beautiful, graceful lines, and as such cautions against thinking of ballet in terms of the
                         arms, legs, and neck and torso as separate parts. This method is well known for eight port de
                         bras that are utilized.

               <h2>BALLET AS A CAREER</h2>
               <p>
                    Professional dancers are generally not well paid, and earn less money than a typical worker. As
                    of 2020, American dancers (including ballet and other dance forms) were paid an average of US$19 per
                    hour, with pay somewhat better for teachers than for performers. The job outlook is not strong,
                    and the competition to get a job is intense, with the number of applicants vastly exceeding the
                    number of job openings. Most jobs involve teaching in private dance schools. Choreographers
                    are paid better than dancers. Musicians and singers are paid better per hour than either dancers
                    or choreographers, about US$30 per hour; however, full-time work is unusual for musicians.

               <p>
                    Teenage girl ballet dancers are prone to stress fractures in the first rib. Posterior ankle
                    impingement syndrome (PAIS) most commonly affects people who perform repetitive plantar flexion,
                    such as ballet dancers. Eating disorders are thought to be common, and a 2014 meta-analysis
                    suggests that studies do indicate that ballet dancers are at higher risk than the general population
                    for several kinds of eating disorders. In addition, some researchers have noted that intensive
                    training in ballet results in lower bone mineral density in the arms.

               <p>
                    Most ballet choreography is written so that it can only be performed by a relatively young
                    dancer. The structure of ballet – in which a (usually) male choreographer or director uses
                    (mostly) women's bodies to express his artistic vision, while ignoring, objectifying, or silencing
                    the women involved[clarification needed] – has been criticized as harming women.
