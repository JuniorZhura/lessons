                    Family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized
                    birth)
                    or affinity (by marriage or other relationship). The purpose of the family is to maintain the
                    well-being
                    of its members and of society. Ideally, families offer predictability, structure, and safety as
                    members
                    mature and learn to participate in the community. Historically, most human societies use family as
                    the
                    primary locus of attachment, nurturance, and socialization.Anthropologists classify most family
                    organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children), patrifocal (a father and his children),
                    conjugal
                    (a wife, her husband, and children, also called the nuclear family), avuncular (a man, his sister,
                    and
                    her children), or extended (in addition to parents and children, may include grandparents, aunts,
                    uncles,
                    or cousins). The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history. The family is
                    also an
                    important economic unit studied in family economics. The word "families" can be used metaphorically
                    to
                    create more inclusive categories such as community, nationhood, and global village.

               <h2>Social</h2>
               <p class="text">
                    One of the primary functions of the family involves providing a framework for the production and
                    reproduction of persons biologically and socially. This can occur through the sharing of material
                    substances (such as food); the giving and receiving of care and nurture (nurture kinship); jural
                    rights
                    and obligations; and moral and sentimental ties. Thus, one's experience of one's family shifts over
                    time.
                    From the perspective of children, the family is a "family of orientation": the family serves to
                    locate
                    children socially and plays a major role in their enculturation and socialization. From the point of
                    view
                    of the parent(s), the family is a "family of procreation", the goal of which is to produce,
                    enculturate
                    and socialize children. However, producing children is not the only function of the family; in
                    societies
                    with a sexual division of labor, marriage, and the resulting relationship between two people, it is
                    necessary for the formation of an economically productive household. C. C. Harris notes that the
                    western
                    conception of family is ambiguous and confused with the household, as revealed in the different
                    contexts
                    in which the word is used. Olivia Harris states this confusion is not accidental, but indicative of
                    the
                    familial ideology of capitalist, western countries that pass social legislation that insists members
                    of a
                    nuclear family should live together, and that those not so related should not live together; despite
                    the
                    ideological and legal pressures, a large percentage of families do not conform to the ideal nuclear
                    family type.

               </p>
               <p class="text">
                    The total fertility rate of women varies from country to country, from a high of 6.76 children
                    born/woman
                    in Niger to a low of 0.81 in Singapore (as of 2015). Fertility is low in most Eastern European and
                    Southern European countries, and high in most sub-Saharan African countries.

                    In some cultures, the mother's preference of family size influences that of the children through
                    early
                    adulthood. A parent's number of children strongly correlates with the number of children that their
                    children will eventually have.

          <div class="types">
               <h2>Types</h2>
               <p class="text">
                    Although early western cultural anthropologists and sociologists considered family and kinship to be
                    universally associated with relations by "blood" (based on ideas common in their own cultures) later
                    research has shown that many societies instead understand family through ideas of living together,
                    the
                    sharing of food (e.g. milk kinship) and sharing care and nurture. Sociologists have a special
                    interest in
                    the function and status of family forms in stratified (especially capitalist) societies. According
                    to the
                    work of scholars Max Weber, Alan Macfarlane, Steven Ozment, Jack Goody and Peter Laslett, the huge
                    transformation that led to modern marriage in Western democracies was "fueled by the
                    religio-cultural
                    value system provided by elements of Judaism, early Christianity, Roman Catholic canon law and the
                    Protestant Reformation". Much sociological, historical and anthropological research dedicates itself
                    to
                    the understanding of this variation, and of changes in the family that form over time. Levitan
                    claims:
                    Times have changed; it is more acceptable and encouraged for mothers to work and fathers to spend
                    more
                    time at home with the children. The way roles are balanced between the parents will help children
                    grow
                    and learn valuable life lessons. There is [the] great importance of communication and equality in
                    families, in order to avoid role strain.
               </p>
               <h3>Multigenerational family</h3>
               <p class="text">
                    Historically, the most common family type was one in which grandparents, parents, and children lived
                    together as a single unit. For example, the household might include the owners of a farm, one (or
                    more)
                    of their adult children, the adult child's spouse, and the adult child's own children (the owners'
                    grandchildren). Members of the extended family are not included in this family group. Sometimes,
                    "skipped" generation families, such as a grandparents living with their grandchildren, are included.
                    In
                    the US, this arrangement declined after World War II, reaching a low point in 1980, when about one
                    out of
                    every eight people in the US lived in a multigenerational family. The numbers have risen since then,
                    with
                    one in five people in the US living in a multigenerational family as of 2016. The increasing
                    popularity
                    is partly driven by demographic changes and the economic shifts associated with the Boomerang
                    Generation.
                    Multigenerational households are less common in Canada, where about 6% of people living in Canada
                    were
                    living in multigenerational families as of 2016, but the proportion of multigenerational households
                    was
                    increasing rapidly, driven by increasing numbers of Aboriginal families, immigrant families, and
                    high
                    housing costs in some regions.

               <h3>Conjugal (nuclear) family</h3>
               <p class="text">
                    The term "nuclear family" is commonly used to refer to conjugal families. A "conjugal" family
                    includes
                    only the spouses and unmarried children who are not of age. Some sociologists distinguish between
                    conjugal families (relatively independent of the kindred of the parents and of other families in
                    general)
                    and nuclear families (which maintain relatively close ties with their kindred). Other family
                    structures –
                    with (for example) blended parents, single parents, and domestic partnerships – have begun to
                    challenge
                    the normality of the nuclear family.
               </p>
               <h3>Single-parent family</h3>
               <p class="text">
                    A single-parent family consists of one parent together with their children, where the parent is
                    either
                    widowed, divorced (and not remarried), or never married. The parent may have sole custody of the
                    children, or separated parents may have a shared-parenting arrangement where the children divide
                    their
                    time (possibly equally) between two different single-parent families or between one single-parent
                    family
                    and one blended family. As compared to sole custody, physical, mental and social well-being of
                    children
                    may be improved by shared-parenting arrangements and by children having greater access to both
                    parents.
                    The number of single-parent families have been increasing, and about half of all children in the
                    United
                    States will live in a single-parent family at some point before they reach the age of 18. Most
                    single-parent families are headed by a mother, but the number of single-parent families headed by
                    fathers
                    is increasing
               </p>
               <h3>Matrifocal family</h3>
               <p class="text">
                    A "matrifocal" family consists of a mother and her children. Generally, these children are her
                    biological
                    offspring, although adoption of children occurs in nearly every society. This kind of family occurs
                    commonly where women have the resources to rear their children by themselves, or where men are more
                    mobile than women. As a definition, "a family or domestic group is matrifocal when it is centred on
                    a
                    woman and her children. In this case, the father(s) of these children are intermittently present in
                    the
                    life of the group and occupy a secondary place. The children's mother is not necessarily the wife of
                    one
                    of the children's fathers." The name, matrifocal, was coined in Guiana but it is defined differently
                    in
                    other countries. For Nayar families, the family have the male as the "center" or the head of the
                    family,
                    either the step-father/father/brother, rather than the mother.

               <h2>Roles</h2>
               <p class="text">
                    Most Western societies employ Eskimo kinship terminology. This kinship terminology commonly occurs
                    in societies with strong conjugal, where families have a degree of relative mobility. Typically,
                    societies with conjugal families also favor neolocal residence; thus upon marriage, a person
                    separates from the nuclear family of their childhood (family of orientation) and forms a new nuclear
                    family (family of procreation). Such systems generally assume that the mother's husband is also the
                    biological father. The system uses highly descriptive terms for the nuclear family and progressively
                    more classificatory as the relatives become more and more collateral.
               </p>
               <h3>Nuclear family</h3>
               <img src="/img/image_3.png" alt="Family tree with some family members.">
               <p class="text">
                    <span>The system emphasizes the nuclear family</span>. Members of the nuclear family use highly descriptive
                    kinship terms, identifying directly only the husband, wife, mother, father, son, daughter, brother,
                    and sister. All other relatives are grouped together into categories. Members of the nuclear family
                    may be lineal or collateral. Kin, for whom these are family, refer to them in descriptive terms that
                    build on the terms used within the nuclear family or use the nuclear family term directly.
